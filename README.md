# Decklink_C

Blackmagic Design Decklink SDK wrapper for C compatability.
This is a minimal auto-generated wrapper around the official C++ SDK.

## Installation

Clone the library and include `include/decklink_c.h` in your project to get going. You will need to have the Decklink
drivers (>=10.9.12) installed on your machine and a compatible device connected to do much with it.

## Usage

The official SDK documentation is a useful reference for this library.

See the examples for more information.
