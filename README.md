# Decklink_C

Blackmagic Design Decklink SDK wrapper for C compatability.
This aims to be an easy to use and safe wrapper around the official C++ SDK.

Note: This is very incomplete, but is working. The examples currently follow the official examples as closely as possible

## Installation

Clone the library and include `include/decklink_c.h` in your project to get going. You will need to have the Decklink
drivers (>=10.9.12) installed on your machine and a compatible device connected to do much with it.

## Usage

See the examples for more information.
